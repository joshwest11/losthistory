<h2>Tartaria...
</h2> 
<p2> Now, you're probably thinking what is tartaria? Tartaria is the name of the pre Mongolian empire that originated in northern Asia before spanning the entire northern hemisphere. Great Tartaria was the largest empire during its time and would have still been the largest empire today. The Tartarian empire flourished due in part of the civilization being a leader in advanced technology, free energy, and grand architecture. Have you ever wondered why there is arcitecture that were supposedly built in 1800s. Did you see the type of technology we had then? No way of lifting boulders up to 3-5 tonnes. They were riding on horse and cart. The tartarians knew a lot more about this world than we do. Look at the Pyramids in Egypt, Arc d'Triomphe in France, Sagrada Familia in Spain, even the Taj Mahal in India. They all are built the same way with the most intricate design. Where else do you see the same style of buildings at that degree at every corner of our world? The same structures are in every city. I dare you to take a day to look for this style of building in your city. They're everywhere and we could never replicate that kind of art anywhere on our planet today, and no don't tell me about the ugly glass and steel buildings we call 'arcitecture' today.<br>
<br>
    Tartaria is also where the Greek word “Tartarus” originated from. Tartarus is a primeval God, the offspring of Chaos. Tarturus is also a part of the underworld where the wicked suffered punishment for their misdeeds, especially those such as Ixion and Tantalus who had committed some outrage against the gods. See the resembelance to other religions? This sounds like hell to me. If you look a little further into it, see there is always half thruths involved. Tarturus also mesans 'an underworld'. Now some time ago, around 2,500 years ago, we are told that there was an event were the ground became unstable. This caused soil liquefaction and buried the tartarians with their empire in mud. A brilliant example of the soil liquefaction is the leaning tower of piza in Rome. So many Tartarian villages, town, cities are buried in the Sahara and Arizona deserts, underneath the grandcanyon underneath every city across the Earth.</p>

    The Tartarians (or Tartars) were the indigenous people (quite possibly founded by Noah’s sons) making up the world renowned Tartarian empire. The Tartarians were tall people, averaging some eight to twelve feet in height. They would have been considered giants to our current average height of only around six feet; however, back then the height of ten feet was the average. Like the civilizations before them whose heights averaged twelve feet, fifty feet, two+ miles, etc… each preceding civilization had an average taller height than the civilizations coming after them and each succeeding civilization had an average shorter height than the civilizations predating them. Statures are diminishing after each deluge and with each new astrological age we enter.

    Civilizations in the current astrological age (the Age of Pisces) are shorter in height than civilizations that existed in the previous astrological age (the Age of Aries) and will be taller in height than civilizations that will exist in the next astrological age (the Age of Aquarius).<p>
    The reason astrological ages has been mentioned is because of the solar clock. This is how before clocks and being able to tell the time of year. The whole concept of time came because of Ancient Tartaria. They understood all of the constellations and grouped them into a circle in 12 incriments of 30 degrees (12 months 30 days a month) 12 x 30 = 360 days for a year. Each section was then designated an animal, for the bigger picture, you would know the age you were in. They knew stars moved around us and it took 24 hours for the star to do a whole 360 degrees. So you you have then the age, the year, month, week, day ect. They knew the Earth was flat and stationary and the whole earth is one massive clock. The Moon and Sun are local to us (not millions of miles away) On one side, the Moon. on the other side, the Sun. Depending on what tinme of year it is the Sun and move travel around the lines of latitude. The equator, Tropic of Cancer, Tropic of Capricon. The same way year round and they know this because of Equinox's in September and March every year. The Equinox is the day where the sun passes directly over the equator in its Northward and Southward movements between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. The Tartarians understood that everything that makes up the Earth isn't what they think it is today. They think today that everything is made up of atoms ect, when everything in this world is made up of vibrations and torodial fields. Us as humans have out own torodial field(electro-magnetism) around us.

    <p3>Let's really get into it now... Have a look at these buildings. We have the Leaning Tower of Pisa (Rome), St Basil's Cathedral (Moscow), Taj Mahal (India), US Capitol Building (Washington), Sagrada Familia (Spain). These buildings are all very similiar, yet they are at all corners of the world. We are told that this style of arcitecture is called Renaissance, and it was built in around the 14th and 15th century. We have also been told that back then all we did was fight over territory and countries were invading each other. So if we were constantly at war please tell me how they had such a headspace or time to build this kind of unbelievable arcitecture. My idea is either that it's a blatant lie that we were always at war with each other. That these buildings have been inherited many generations before. We lived as one big world with independant nations that worked together for the good of humanity. We have lost so much from the time period before/during Jesus Christ and after his death, since then the governments around the world has systematically destroyed or repurposed these power stations as government buildings. In the 15th century we couldn't cure people of the common cold but we could build such arcitecture. Don't make me laugh! After a little deeper reserach I found that St Basil's Cathederal was built in 1200 AD! Furthermore there is a story told to people about how the Taj Mahal was built by an Indian emperor in rememberance of his wife in 1632. The official narrative says that he built it in 22 years with 1000 elephants and a lot of manual labour. I just really dont believe someone would go to this much, just to house his late-wife. Anyway you can see for yourself. </p3>

<p>So.. what are you thinking? How did we, thousands of years ago build these magnificent buildings? Without any technology? Give me strength! On St Basil's Cathedral, how did they bend the metal the create the top of the buildings before any kind of technology to do such a thing (we were hunters and gatherers they say). How did we transport the sheer amount of building materials? How in the Sagrada Familia, Taj Mahal, Capitol building, do you think they sculpted the walls with that much precision and why? They went to so much just so it looks nice and people would call them holy places and pray in them? I dont believe it. These buildings have came from the same era, in addition these buildings are spread across the world, this tells me that the tartarians had a massive influence on the world and it doesn't seem to be in a particularly in a negative way. </p>

Now what I'm showing you next is going to show you why this amazing race of people were wiped from the earth. You won't even believe it...

Once upon a time there was a highly advanced civilization today known as Great Tartaria. She was disappeared from our history books less than a century ago. However its vestiges are still everywhere. This civilization dominated technologies more advanced than the present ones. Its geopolymer concrete was eternal and grew stronger over time. Its gigantic iron and glass structures, surmounted by domes and metal needles, were present on every continent. Associated with mercury, they distributed free atmospheric energy to everyone. Its towers and railway stations are still in operation. Unfortunately, the technology of free energy from the Aether was destroyed and “imprisoned” and old technology reintroduced, like cables and wires to distribute energy and make handsome profits. You could travel by boat, car or plane for free by simply accessing Natures magnetrical energy that is omnipresent and we have not been ‘allowed’ this free energy to all due to our capitalist system of greed and domination by those in power even to this day. So, for over 100 hundred years we have been denied a benevolent system of free energy to all.

The Fake History has called the ancient architecture as ”Moorish revival” or “Mauresque” and “Islamic”. And also “Colonial”, “Medieval”, “Neoclassical”, “Baroque”, “Romanesque”, “Gothic”, “Beaux Arts”, “Eclectic”, “Tudor”, “Renaissance”, “Palladian”, “Richardsonian Romanesque”, “Chicago School” or “Victorian”, and labeled them as fashionable styles, to hide the old and true function of its columns, arched openings, pinnacles, rose windows, naves ornamented with iron columns, towers, and domes. In addition to having cut the ends of the pinnacles in the photographs or added crosses that did not exist before.
<br>
His-story tells us that the first power stations were first established in Cairo, Egypt in 876, according to Wikipedia. It is the largest and oldest in Egypt, in its original form. All Tartaria power stations, small and large, had pipe organs to harmonize and heal the population through sound waves, what is now known as “cymatics”. The churches and cathedrals we see throughout the world all share similar design patterns that were designed with sacred acoustic geometry to maximize vibration, tone and resonance to heal and help download higher consciousness. After the Great Purge of the Tartarians, the religious orders, spearheaded by the Romanov’s, reconstituted these amazing structures into Presbyterian, Catholic, Anglican, Mormon synagogue, mosque temples et cetera.

<h4>The Arcitecture of Extracting Free Energy</h4>

<p>The world architecture for electromagnetic energy extraction derives entirely from the High Civilization Tartar-Aryan. It is characterized by the use of arch openings, columns, domes and towers. In addition to details such as rose windows and muqarnas; symbols of the vibration of electromagnetic energy which acts on molecules and changes the behavior of cells. Formerly these waves could act in healing, levitation and transport, besides provoking feelings like harmony and euphoria. The architecture of the Tartaria undergoes slight modifications and influences according to the local characteristics of climate, culture and material resources but maintains the basic principles throughout the world.</p>

    <p>You will find that pyramids, theaters and Colosseum’s all had water channels running under them directly where the sound energy was directed. The Star Forts seem to have been designed to create a micro-dome that protected the inhabitants and resonate harmony. This was detailed in Tesla’s 3-dimensional shell which is created by interfering two Fourier-expansion, 3-dimensional scalar hemispherical patterns in space so that they pair-couple into a dome-like shell of intense, ordinary electromagnetic energy. The air molecules and atoms in the shell are totally ionized and thus highly excited, giving off intense glowing light. Anything physical which hits the shell receives an enormous discharge of electrical energy and is instantly vaporized — it goes pfft! like a bug hitting one of the electrical bug killers now so much in vogue.</p>
    
    <p>The elite survived by utilizing them during the resets. Look at some old depictions of star forts that were surrounded by walls of mud and remained mostly undamaged. Imagine a society that created free energy with classical arts and that their jobs were musical in nature. On the Solfeggio scale 528 Hz is significant. These sound frequencies created made plants, humans and animals grow larger and maintained a temperate climate. All cities located at strategic points on Earth along canals, rivers, seas, lakes and oceans had (and where remnants still exist) Star Fortresses which extracted electromagnetic energy from the ether. The energy was then captured through towers and obelisks and stored in the red and white striped power stations of the High Civilization we now call Great Tartaria.</p>

    <p>The electromagnetic energy was extracted and stored in toroid coils at the power plant summits, covered with copper, positioned below the towers. Star Forts coordinated the distribution of water, gas and electromagnetic energy throughout the Earth, ran the world food and transport system, was responsible for all communications, health, education, culture, and well-being.</p>
    
    <p>Underground tunnels, magnificent communicating vessels with platforms and palaces, interconnected all the cities around the world, running without disruption. Through them traveled billions of people, luggage, objects, and correspondence. On the surface, well-planned cities, magnificent buildings, huge parks, power plants, music, culture, art. In the sky, immense airships for those who prefer to observe the world from a bird’s eye point of view. An inaccessible world, forever lost, whose traces can only be found in yellowed photographs, in the contemplation of buildings whose architecture seems incomprehensible by today’s standards.</p>

    <p>Great Tartaria had no colonies. It was a One World civilization, united in common understanding and speaking the same language – Tartar (Arabic) and Sanskrit. A One World civilization without frontiers, with independent nations, ruled by qualified princes, elected by a local council of wise men but counseled by women.</p>

    I hope you have enjoyed the site, I hope you come away knowing more about the Tartarian race and their many, purposely forgotten gifts to humanity. Share all of the information here with your family and friends to spread the word about these forgotton people.

    Thank You!
