<h1 class="large">Welcome Truth Seekers</h1>

<p class = "p1"> Do any of us really know anything about who came before us? We had many wars, we were battling with disease, we had ruthless tyrants, blah blah blah. The point I'm getting at is we aren't really told anything more than that. That's why I have created this site. 
<br>
I have created this site because I am very interested in our true history. Not the his-story you get taught in school, but the history that is all around us. We just don't see it at first glance, well atleast we don't question where it came from, we simply just acknowledge it's there, get our phones out and due to the sheer amount of tourists at the site we take a photo and move on. Someone I have listened to recently has spoken about this, he said, "I think that when we turn up to these tourist sites of old buildings and structures, say like the Arc d'Triomphe, the madness of people being everywhere, you lose the chance to really appreciate what is infront of you, let alone question anything." he went on to say that with the amount of people at the site, you don't even have time to think. 
<br>
By now you're probably wondering, what's he talking about? Well mainly what and who I am going to talk about is on this site is Tartaria and the Tartarian race. What do you know about them? It hasn't been long since I've known who they are, I had never heard of them. But why? We hear about the Romans, Tudors, Victorians, Vikings, Greeks, Egyptians ect (not to say that what we have been taught about them is 100% true) but why haven't we been taught about the most amazing and most ancient race of them all. The most advanced civilization known to man and they were on this planet still about 150 years ago since something unimaginable happened. Also these people were built differently than we are today, just look below at Batu Han- once leader of this race of people. He lived for 275 years! Have I got your attention yet? 
<br>
I hope so, scroll to the bottom of the page and click on Let's Dive In for more some shocking information that you probably won't believe it at first. Alls I ask is you go into this with an open mind. Things might get a bit mad. </p>
