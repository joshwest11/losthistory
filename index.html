<h1 class="large">Welcome, Truth Seekers</h1>
<p class = "p1"> Do any of us really know anything about who came before us? We had many wars, we were battling with disease, we had ruthless tyrants, blah blah blah. The point I'm getting at is we aren't really told anything more than that. That's why I have created this site. This site is dedicated to finding more information about ancient people of the world. Mostly it's how humanity used to be. How did they live? How did they build? How did they combat disease? Lets go and find out.<p>I'm going to take you down a path, but before I begin you need to be going into this with an open mind. </p>

<h2>We are going to start with Tartaria...
</h2> 
<p2> Now, you're probably thinking what is tartaria? Tartaria is the name of the pre Mongolian empire that originated in northern Asia before spanning the entire northern hemisphere. Great Tartaria was the largest empire during its time and would have still been the largest empire today. The Tartarian empire flourished due in part of the civilization being a leader in advanced technology, free energy, and grand architecture. Have you ever wondered why there is arcitecture that were supposedly built in 1800s. Did you see the type of technology we had then? No way of lifting boulders up to 3-5 tonnes. They were riding on horse and cart. The tartarians knew a lot more about this world than we do. Look at the Pyramids in Egypt, Arc d'Triomphe in France, Sagrada Familia in Spain, even the Taj Mahal in India. They all are built the same way with the most intricate design. Where else do you see the same style of buildings at that degree at every corner of our world? The same structures are in every city. I dare you to take a day to look for this style of building in your city. They're everywhere and we could never replicate that kind of art anywhere on our planet today, and no don't tell me about the ugly glass and steel buildings we call 'arcitecture' today.<br>
<br>
    Tartaria is also where the Greek word “Tartarus” originated from. Tartarus is a primeval God, the offspring of Chaos. Tarturus is also a part of the underworld where the wicked suffered punishment for their misdeeds, especially those such as Ixion and Tantalus who had committed some outrage against the gods. See the resembelance to other religions? This sounds like hell to me. If you look a little further into it, see there is always half thruths involved. Tarturus also mesans 'an underworld'. Now some time ago, around 2,500 years ago, we are told that there was an event were the ground became unstable. This caused soil liquefaction and buried the tartarians with their empire in mud. A brilliant example of the soil liquefaction is the leaning tower of piza in Rome. So many Tartarian villages, town, cities are buried in the Sahara and Arizona deserts, underneath the grandcanyon underneath every city across the Earth.</p>

    The Tartarians (or Tartars) were the indigenous people (quite possibly founded by Noah’s sons) making up the world renowned Tartarian empire. The Tartarians were tall people, averaging some eight to twelve feet in height. They would have been considered giants to our current average height of only around six feet; however, back then the height of ten feet was the average. Like the civilizations before them whose heights averaged twelve feet, fifty feet, two+ miles, etc… each preceding civilization had an average taller height than the civilizations coming after them and each succeeding civilization had an average shorter height than the civilizations predating them. Statures are diminishing after each deluge and with each new astrological age we enter.
    
    Civilizations in the current astrological age (the Age of Pisces) are shorter in height than civilizations that existed in the previous astrological age (the Age of Aries) and will be taller in height than civilizations that will exist in the next astrological age (the Age of Aquarius).<p>
    The reason astrological ages has been mentioned is because of the solar clock. This is how before clocks and being able to tell the time of year. The whole concept of time came because of Ancient Tartaria. They understood all of the constellations and grouped them into a circle in 12 incriments of 30 degrees (12 months 30 days a month) 12 x 30 = 360 days for a year. Each section was then designated an animal, for the bigger picture, you would know the age you were in. They knew stars moved around us and it took 24 hours for the star to do a whole 360 degrees. So you you have then the age, the year, month, week, day ect. They knew the Earth was flat and stationary and the whole earth is one massive clock. The Moon and Sun are local to us (not millions of miles away) On one side, the Moon. on the other side, the Sun. Depending on what tinme of year it is the Sun and move travel around the lines of latitude. The equator, Tropic of Cancer, Tropic of Capricon. The same way year round and they know this because of Equinox's in September and March every year. The Equinox is the day where the sun passes directly over the equator in its Northward and Southward movements between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. The Tartarians understood that everything that makes up the Earth isn't what they think it is today. They think today that everything is made up of atoms ect, when everything in this world is made up of vibrations and torodial fields. Us as humans have out own torodial field(electro-magnetism) around us.

    <p3>Let's really get into it now... Have a look at these buildings. We have the Leaning Tower of Pisa (Rome), St Basil's Cathedral (Moscow), Taj Mahal (India), US Capitol Building (Washington), Sagrada Familia (Spain). These buildings are all very similiar, yet they are at all corners of the world. We are told that this style of arcitecture is called Renaissance, and it was built in around the 14th and 15th century. We have also been told that back then all we did was fight over territory and countries were invading each other. So if we were constantly at war please tell me how they had such a headspace or time to build this kind of unbelievable arcitecture. My idea is either that it's a blatant lie that we were always at war with each other, and we lived as a humanity instead of your country against ours and built such beauty. Or that these buildings have been inherited many generations before. I believe that it's the latter. In the 15th century we couldn't cure people of the common cold but we could build such arcitecture. Don't make me laugh! Anyway you can see for yourself. </p3>

<p>So.. what are you thinking? How did we, thousands of years ago build these magnificent buildings? Without any technology? Give me strength! On St Basil's Cathedral, how did they bend the metal the create the top of the buildings before any kind of technology to do such a thing (we were hunters and gatherers they say). How did we transport the sheer amount of building materials? How in the Sagrada Familia, Taj Mahal, Capitol building, do you think they sculpted the walls with that much precision and why? They went to so much just so it looks nice and people would call them holy places and pray in them? I dont believe it. </p>
